			<h1>Experiment 7 - Data Visualization & Networks</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Imitate</h2>
				<p> To start this project I looked at examples from class and section. At first I didnt find anything to intriguing so I tried to find an API online to use.</p>
				<p>I did find one but didnt like it to much so I instead opted for the dad joke API.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Integrate</h2>
				<p> In this step I wanted to reuse some methods that I had previosuly tried in other experiments. One of them being spawning multiple objects at one time.  </p>
				<p>In this case is was multiple dad jokes. I also put a counter in the program to show the number of dad jokes fetched.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Innovate</h2>
				<p>I found this the most challenging part of the project as I did not really know what I wanted to do. </p>
				<p>I made some features for the program that might it more difficult for the user to generate more dad jokes. I found this a fun and engaging way to experince the jokes.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>Each person that worked on the code should reflect on the process, the difficulties, and the successes of the experiment. Here's where you can put your reflections.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>What part of the project you contributed</li>
					<p>I worked on everything</p>
					<li>A reflection on your work and the work of the team</li>
					<p>I was enjoying my time towards the end of this project as I messed around with how a user would generate dad jokes. In the begnning though having to stop working with the first API I found was annoying because I spent so much time trying to learn it.</p>
					<li>Brief highs and lows</li>
					<p>The high of this assignment was getting the program to run with all the new features I implemented. The low would be having to stop working with the first API I wanted to use for this experiment</p>
				</ul>
