			<h1>Experiment 3 - Generative Methods</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Imitate</h2>
				<p>I started with an example from the open processing website and then quickly found that example to be to complex for what I wanted to do for this experiment.
				<p>I then looked at another example on the website that had a cool distortion effect and that was the example I used as the foundation for the assigment</p>
			
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Integrate</h2>
				<p>During this experiment I made sure to make use of the noise function that was talked about during lecture and section. This was mainly used for how the color of the animation changes each time the animation runs.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Innovate</h2>
				<p>Through trial and error of trying to work with pots and then dropping that idea for the distortion effect the result was quite intresting. I continously messed around with the distortion effect and noise
					to create this really nice wave effect. The animation is also smooth with no lag issues
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>Each person that worked on the code should reflect on the process, the difficulties, and the successes of the experiment. Here's where you can put your reflections.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>What part of the project you contributed</li>
					<p>I worked on everything</p>

					<li>A reflection on your work and the work of the team</li>
					<p> This experiment was a fun one to work on. Testing how noise works and push it as far as I could take it to create this unqiue piece felt truely rewarding.</p>

					<li>Brief highs and lows</li>
					<p> The high for me was getting to the end result as the animation was pretty much exactly what I wanted. The low was when I tried to force the pot example that I looked at into the code and it just never worked out</p>
				</ul>
