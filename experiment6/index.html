			<h1>Experiment 6 - Grammar & Text Art</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Imitate</h2>
				<p>To start this experiment I looked through the examples that were given in lecture and section. One in particular from section piqued my intrest and 
					I started the experiment using the code from the example as a starting point. 
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Integrate</h2>
				<p> I saw from lecutre that Tracery could have been used to compelete this assigment. I had experince with the tool before but I didnt want to go for a generative
					story but instead a linear one. This story would have a set path and would repeat over and over infinetely. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Innovate</h2>
				<p>For the innovate step I thought that creating a simple story of emotions and things one does in a day through text art was a unqiue thing. 
					The waterfall effect helps with this idea as time moves on with with no breaks in between. As you move from one set of words to the next you can 
					still see the previous which shows how those feelings may still linger even if time has moved on. There is also the idea of the cycle that repeats
					over and over as the set of words in this program never change. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>Each person that worked on the code should reflect on the process, the difficulties, and the successes of the experiment. Here's where you can put your reflections.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>What part of the project you contributed</li>
					<p>I worked on everything</p>
					<li>A reflection on your work and the work of the team</li>
					<p>This was a pretty fun assignment to work on. I was really happy with the results and I am glad I was able to share my ideas in this creative way.</p>
					<li>Brief highs and lows</li>
					<p>One of the major highs of this assignment was getting the waterfall effect to work. The low of this assignment was trying to figure out
						the best way to represent the set of words to give off the effect that time is moving in some sort of way. </p>
				</ul>
