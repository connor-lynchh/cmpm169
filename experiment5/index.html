			<h1>Experiment 5 - 3D Graphics</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Imitate</h2>
				<p>I started with looking at the examples that were given in lecture but none of them seem to have grab my attention. I then got an example off open processing
					that more alligned with my vision. I used the code from the example as a foundation to start my experiment</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Integrate</h2>
				<p> After going through lecture and learning all the different ways to edit and change the way 3D graphics look in p5.js. I impelemented 
					lighting and 3D objects and had the objects moving on the x, y, and z axis. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Innovate</h2>
				<p>After changing a lot of my design and going from a couple of 3D objects moving up and down I came to this pong type idea. I really enjoyed 
					the direction the experiment went as before the pong art I was not particularly satisfied with the program. So I am glad I was able to pivot 
					into something familiar but on a whole new perspective.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>Each person that worked on the code should reflect on the process, the difficulties, and the successes of the experiment. Here's where you can put your reflections.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>What part of the project you contributed</li>
					<p>I worked on the entire thing</p>
					<li>A reflection on your work and the work of the team</li>
					<p>This experiment was a little easier to work through. Opening up p5.js to the 3D plane created many new opportunties for creative work. 
						The end result I got was unexpected as I planned for a different kind of art design but this end product is something I apperciate a lot more considering my background in games</p>
					<li>Brief highs and lows</li>
					<p>The high of this experiment was pivoting to this pong idea and then fulling getting the 3D perspective as you can drag around the image
						to see the 3D shapes in action. The low was everything before the pong idea as I did not really know where this experiment was going 
					</p>
