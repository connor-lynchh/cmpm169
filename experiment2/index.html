			<h1>Experiment 2 - Vector Art, Animation & Interactivity</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Imitate</h2>
				<p>I started with looking at the examples on the generative design website.</p>
				<p>I choose the example that looked most intresting to me and started modifying it</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Integrate</h2>
				<p>With this code I now have I wanted to have my own shapes in places of the ones that were given in the example.</p>
				<p>This required me to draw triangles, rectangles, ellipses as well as custom shapes. I also had to use the random function to make the color of the shapes change.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Innovate</h2>
				<p>To innovate on this example and create something new I wanted to go further with my random color generation.</p>
				<p>Beyond there being a key to change the color of the shapes you can now move your cursor to one of the four quadrants on the grid to change the color.</p>
				<p>On top of that when the color changes when moving your cursor to a new quadrant the previous shape stays behind until its covered up by other shapes.
			
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>Each person that worked on the code should reflect on the process, the difficulties, and the successes of the experiment. Here's where you can put your reflections.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>I worked on the entire thing</li>
					<li>This project took longer than expected. My most favorite part was getting the cursor to change the color of the shapes when moving into a different quadrant.</li>
					<li>The highlight for me is when I implemented another examples code and it creating a cool effect that I never would have expected. The lows would be  when it took forever to debug the way the colors would change on the shapes as it was never uniform but instead random for each individual shape. 4</li>
