			<h1>Experiment 4 - Images, Video, & Sound Art</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Imitate</h2>
				<p> I started looking at design processing examples and searched for video examples. I used one of the numerous examples as a foundation for the experiment I wanted to work on. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Integrate</h2>
				<p> After essentially stripping out most of the code other than the webcam functionality I started integrating sound effects and images that layered over the webcam video. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Innovate</h2>
				<p> After going through the hardships of trying to make tint() work I found another solution to getting the color of the image to change when colliding with the border of the canvas.</p>
				<p> With that now set in place I finally had a functioning DVD screen saver but instead you have yourself as the DVD logo. On top of that a sound effect will play when hitting one of the four corners of the canvas.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>Each person that worked on the code should reflect on the process, the difficulties, and the successes of the experiment. Here's where you can put your reflections.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>What part of the project you contributed</li>
					<p>I worked on everything</p>
					<li>A reflection on your work and the work of the team</li>
					<p>This felt like the easiest experiment to dive into and mess around with. Getting access to the webcam was a lot less complicated then I thought it would be. What was actually difficult was over laying things ontop of the webcam image</p>
					<li>Brief highs and lows</li>
					<p>The high for me in this experiment was getting the image to move around on the screen like it does now. The low would be trying to use tint() and then scrapping that idea to use an alternative that worked just as good</p>
				</ul>
